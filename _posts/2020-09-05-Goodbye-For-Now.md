Thank you all for helping us. While I may have been skeptical of your support (and as I've seen, maybe rightfully so), you have shown yourselves
to be extremely helpful and resourceful in a time of crisis. I would like to extend my thanks to all of you who helped Jeremy defeat ANGEL.  

As for us, I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen with TISA now. After Jeremy told us what happened, we returned to the TISA site to see a massive
crater where the building once was. All the anomalies were there, though trapped under rubble, but the plate was entirely missing. Will gathered his remaining team
to search for it in the surrounding area but had no luck. As for the other anomalies, we're going to try to find another place for them to stay. Most likely
a building of our own, rebuilt with tech we had lying around. Olive is working on figuring that out right now.  

As for Stacy, I don't know what's going to happen yet. I'm going to wait until Jeremy is a bit better before I ask him about a funeral. After all, he would know
what she would've wanted better than any of us. We'll probably have her funeral at the same time as Radia's though. May they both rest in peace.  

Well, I don't have anything else to say. While we might always be in the middle of our story, I think this is where our's part ways.

Thank you,
Janice
