We started this website with the intention of spreading the beautiful creations people have made to bring some positivity
to the world during these rough times. However, over and over again, we have received messages from hateful people
wanting to shut us down. We're making this post today to say this to all of them, especially the group that goes by "Ruined World":
we understand there are bad things happening. We understand that people are down. We aren't turning a blind eye.
This website is meant to cheer them up.
So let's show them beauty.
