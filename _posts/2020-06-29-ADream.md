I had a dream last night. Maybe more like a nightmare because of the overwhelming sense of dread I felt. I was floating in nothingness, the only thing I could see was a door. Then I heard scratching. The scratching sounds started behind the door then slowly got closer and closer until they felt like they were inside my brain.  

And then the door opened, letting in a flood of light that created a platform under my feet, and out stepped a monster. It had the legs and head of a goat but the torso of a human and it looked me in the eyes and said "You're a new face".  

When I woke up a ran to my sketchbook at fast as I could, and quickly drew as much of the scene as I could. - Olive
