eruptive lightnings flutter to and fro
above the heights of immemorial hills;
thirst-stricken air, dumb-throated, in its Woe
limply down-sagging, its limp body spills
upon the earth. A panting silence fills
The empty vault of night with shimmering bars
of Cullen silver, where the lake distils
its misered bounty.â€”Hark! No whisper mars
the utter silence of the untranslated stars.
