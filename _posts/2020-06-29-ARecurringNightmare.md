I keep having a terrible nightmare.  

At first, I was standing on a white platform, the space around me completely dark. A purple eye was above me, staring down, and while I couldn't see what was there I could feel the prescence of a massive creature. I felt it move and it's eye disappeared and then my own name rang in my head until I woke up.

The next dreams are the same, but instead of being on the ground, I'm floating in the air, looking down at myself from my first nightmare. This time I can see the creatures hand, looming over me like its about to swat a fly. It then puts its hand over me and my name sounds all around me, ringing in my ears until I wake up.  

I tried drawing it this morning. Maybe there's something you all can get out of it. - Will
