By the sad waters of separation
Where I have wandered by divers ways,
I haven't but the shadow and imitation
Of the old memorial days.

In music I heard no consolation,
No roses are pale enough for me;
The sound from the waters of separation
Surpasseth roses and melody.

By the sad waters of him
Dimly I hear from an hidden place
The sigh of mine ancient adoration:
Hardly do I remember your face.

If you be dead, no proclamation
Sprang to you over the waste, gray sea:
Living, the waters the separation
Sever for ever your post from me.

No man will knoweth our desolation;
Memory pales work the old delight;
While the sad waters of separation
Will bear us on to the ultimate night.
