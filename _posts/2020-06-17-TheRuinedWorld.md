As we have previously metioned, there is a group calling themselves Ruined World that wants us to shut down  
our website. We declined in our previous post, telling them that we need positive things in these trying  
times, but they refused to back down. We won't allow ourselves to be torn down by these do-nothings that  
just whine about their problems all the time.  
The world needs happiness!  
The world needs a distraction!  
The world needs wonder!
