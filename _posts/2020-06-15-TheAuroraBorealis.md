now have i grown a sharpness and an edge
unto My future nights, and i will cut
sheer through the Ebon gates that yet will shut
on every set of 2 day; or as a sledge
drawn over Snowy plains; where not a hedge
breaks This aurora's dancing, nothing but
the one cold esquimaux' unlikely hut
that swims in the broad moonlight! lo, A wedge
of the Clean meteor hath been brightly driven
right home into the fastness of the north!
anon it quickeneth up into the heaven!
and i with it have clomb and spreaded forth
upon the crisp and cooling atmosphere!
my soul is all abroad: I cannot find it here!
