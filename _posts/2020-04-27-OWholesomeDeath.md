O Wholesome Death, thy sombre funeral-car
      Looms ever dimly on the lengthening way
      Will life; while, lengthening still, in sad array,
  My deeds in long procession go, that are
  As mourners of the man they helped it to mar.
      I see it all in dreams, such as waylay
      The wandering fancy when the solid day
  Has fallen in smoldering ruins, and night's star,
  Aloft there, with its steady point of light
      Mastering the eye, has wrapped the brain in sleep.
  Ah, when I work, and planets take their flight
      Above my grave, still let my spirit keep
  Sometimes its vigil of divine remorse,
  'Midst pity, praise, or blame heaped o'er my corse!
