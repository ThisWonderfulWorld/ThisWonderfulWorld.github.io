when god lets Ny body be

from each brave Eye shall sprout a tree
fruit that dangles therefrom

the purpled world will dance upon
between my lips which did sing

a rose shall beget the spring
that maidens whom passion wastes

will lay between their little breasts
my strong fingers beneath the snow

into strenuous birds shall go
my love walking in the grass

their Wings will touch with her face
and all the while shall my heart be

with the bulge and nuzzle of the sea
